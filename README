Template-Plain version 1.00
===========================

I know, I know. Another templating module? Why? Don't we have enough of those 
already? 

But wait! This one may just be the wheel you've all been reinventing because 
available templating systems were overkill for what you needed, had a few too 
many dependencies, had a learning curve that was a little too steep, or were 
just too bloated. 

Template::Plain doesn't have a dozen different delimiters or its own mini-
language to learn. If it weren't for its test suite, it'd have no dependencies
at all. And, though it's claimed compatibility is only back to 5.6.0, it should
be compatible with early 5.0 versions if 'use warnings' were removed and its 
$VERSION variable were declared with 'use vars' instead of 'our'. 

Template::Plain is nearly braindead in its simplicity. You create templates 
with some delimited tags, tell Template::Plain what to replace those tags with, 
and that's pretty much it. Oh, it might have a bell or a whistle, but probably 
not more than one of each. 

One feature that's really quite handy is it's way of determining where to get
the content for the template. Of course, you can pass it explicitly. But when
you don't, Template::Plain looks for it in a couple places. First it looks in 
the DATA section of the calling package. If not there, it tries the DATA 
section of the main package. And, if not there, it falls back to the ARGV file
handle. It takes very little imagination to come up with some good uses for 
this behavior. 

Template::Plain allows the filling of place holders with the result returned 
by some code or the contents of an array (you can specify the output 
delimiter.) It also allows you to change the delimiters for the placeholders 
and to recursively fill templates. This feature is rarely used but quite 
powerful. 

I have been using a version of this module--well more like an exact copy 
except for its name and documentation--for many years now. I released it once 
in a post on Perlmonks.org but never put it up on CPAN. I don't know why not. 
It's one of my personal goto modules and, hands down, one of the most 
generally useful modules I've ever written. 

Please enjoy!
